# git-exercise
In-person exercise in SCAS conference room with Julia

This project consists of .txt files that will eventually make up a full dissertation project. 
Each .txt file corresponds to a component (introduction, chapters, conclusion) of what will make up a dissertation project. 

As of 7 May 2023, there is only one file in the repository (chapter1.txt). 

Because dissertations are individual projects, typically without any collaboration a part from the guidance and advising of a dissertation committee, 
this project should not have any collaborators.
